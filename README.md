## Linear Programming Java Library
A simple Java library for solving linear programming optimisation problems

Still in development, currently only supports 2D optimisation.

Check out my [other repo](https://github.com/thealexcons/linear-programming-2d) written in Python which solves 2D linear programming problems, 
with a plot of the feasible region and constraints (better for visual learning).
