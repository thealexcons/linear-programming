## jLinProg: A Linear Programming Library for Java
A simple Java library for solving linear programming optimisation problems.
Currently supports:

- 2D optimisation using the vertex testing method
    - Minimisation and maximisation
    - Integer only mode can be set
- N-dimensional optimisation using the simplex tableau method
    - Maximisation only
    - Still being tested
    
Todo:
- Finish simplex tableau method
- Add graphing feature for 2D problems


Check out my [other repo](https://github.com/thealexcons/linear-programming-2d) written in Python which solves 2D linear programming problems, 
with a plot of the feasible region and constraints (better for visual learning). I wrote this code a while ago so that I could
teach my students this topic in A Level Maths and to verify their solutions to exercises.
